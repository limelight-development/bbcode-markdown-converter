[b]What the fuck are you on about you inactive bitch?[/b]
Listen fuck bois. I want us to do two things:

1. Remove tranq and tranq ammo from the market and move them to be a schematic that MUST be crafted.

2. Move tasers and their cartridges to the market and out of the crafting section.

[b]BUT MY OP TRANQS REEEEEEEEE[/b]
Now hold the fuck on billy bob. I'm doing this for two reasons:

1. Tranqs are OP af and honestly needs some type of handicap. Why not use its stupid OP abilities (Until my tranq rework is done hehehe) to promote crafting more? Maybe even make it super fucking hard to make since it's an OP piece of hot garbage. If you didn't notice, I think the tranq is trash and if you use it, you're the equivalent of using a 725 and M4A1 with Overkill on the new CoD.

2. Tasers are a FAAAAARR inferior, but an effective less-lethal weapon that is currently too expensive to make and irrelevant when I can just buy a peashooter that can knock my ass out like the elephant I am. 

This way we get rid of (more like suppress) an OP weapon in favor of the taser, a less powerful, yet effective weapon. Balancing PvP and promoting crafting more in the process
